# Amazon-Vine-Analysis

## Purpose
Companies that sell on Amazon can pay for review services. As a data anyalyst, we want to see how useful the paid product review members are. To anyalyze reviews, we will look at both groups of customers, the paid reviewers and the unpaid reviewers. We have used Pyspark to extract the data and we have connected the dataset to our AWS server and PGAdmin to further understand the data with SQL.

# Summary
## 51% of people who were getting paid submitted a 5-star review, compared to 38% of the non paid users. This shows that there is probably a slight bias when people are getting paid for their reviews. Therefore, this would likely be a good investment for vendors selling products on amazon.
